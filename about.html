            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Zugrăvel Teodor and I am a 14-year-old free and open source software developer, I mainly code in the C++ and Python programming languages but I also like to make websites in HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey began when I first discovered the power of the Python programming language when I was 11 years old, after that I started learning more and more about programming, Unix like operating systems and digital freedom. Now I am a power user, using WM's and a keyboard driven workflow to do stuff more efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                I focus on writing code that is useful to others and myself, I also contribute to multiple FOSS projects and share my ideas trough this website and online forums, I am also thinking of starting a youtube channel.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time outside, learning more about computers, philosophy, history, science, biology, math and astronomy. I prefer spending time whitout social media, TV, video games and other superficial entertainment.
